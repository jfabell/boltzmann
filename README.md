# boltzmann

1D3V hybrid electron PIC-MCC Boltzmann solver using ES-WPNC particle resampling methodology.

For clarity, the different binning strategies are separated (fixing this is work in progress).

The test problems can be run by manually setting the electric field and disabling the heavy species + voltage PDE solves.
In 0-D, the spatial advection must be turned off.

The conda environment requirement list is provided.
